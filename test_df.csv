"NEWELL, Mr Arthur Webster",58.0,Male,C1,Cherbourg,0.0,113.0,"        mr arthur webster newell, 58, was born in chelsea, massachusetts, on january 30, 1854, the only child of benjamin and susan (bennett) newell. he was educated in chelsea's public schools. at an early age, he began to support himself. a brilliant student, eager to learn, he began working as a clerk in a boston bank. he later became a bookkeeper in the fourth national bank of boston. with the growth of business in its neighborhood, and particularly with the development of the great markets and provision houses on which the bank relied, it quickly grew in size and importance. arthur newell knew his business well. he was quick, accurate and reliable.  on october 11, 1877, arthur newell married his childhood sweetheart, mary greeley, also from chelsea, massachusetts.  in 1879, newell was appointed the bank's chief cashier. after his promotion, a daughter named madeleine was born on october 10, 1880, followed two years later by a second daughter, named alice, in 1882.  as his position in the bank advanced, mr newell's success permitted his family to move from chelsea to lexington, massachusetts, in 1888. here he bought a large home which was landscaped into an attractive gentleman's farm. mr newell became an earnest and devoted citizen of the town. aside from his business, his strongest lay in the hancock congregational church. he was ardent supporter and an upright, influential member whose convictions were deep and whose religious temperament and devotion were unmistakable.  on february 12, 1889, a third daughter was born to mr and mrs newell whom they named marjorie.  although a respected and successful businessma, mr newell attended strictly to his own business, and preferred the direct approach to any diplomacy. he had a singularly high regard for truth. flattery never left his lips and praise from him was a simple statement of fact - an act of judgment. his daughter marjorie later said that her father's inner clarity of spirit made him a keen judge of honesty and reliability in others. it was said that honest people had nothing to fear from him but the double-dealer might well avoid him.  to those who knew mr newell well, he was in outward demeanor what the world called ""cold."" his character appeared distant and austere in social circles. his companions were many, but few were close. neighbors respected him but his association with them was infrequent. as far as she could think, marjorie remembered that even her mother addressed her husband, at least in public, as ""mr newell.""  yet, mr newell was an exceedingly sensitive man who knew how highly charged words between people could be in causing pleasure and pain. to those who knew him well, he was among the most affectionate of men with a tenderness unsuspected by those who saw only the surface. despite an almost puritan character, he envinced love and warmth often.  marjorie remembered an occasion when she was a young girl of about 7 or 8. one summer, she and a neighbor boy were playing in the barn next to the newell home. the ladder leading to the loft seemed daring and together they climbed the rungs when they heard the groom approaching the barn door. the children hid among the hay bales, secretly watching from above. unknown to them, mr newell had asked one of his farm hands to kill a turkey for dinner. just as the hatchet was raised, piercing screams filled the barn. mr newell raced in where the farm hand had frozen in his tracks. the children were crying uncontrollably and quietly mr newell brought them down. before the children, he ordered that the turkey be spared (at least for the time being), and spent the entire afternoon comforting and playing with them.  another occasion occurred when madeleine, alice and marjorie were eating dinner at the dining room table. for an unknown reasons, the girls were giggling among themselves, annoying mr newell. without saying a word, he took his knife and tapped his water glass three times with a look of disapproval. this signified a quick end to the giggling. after dessert, however, mr newell perhaps concerned about his stern technique, took each daughter on one of their long walks through the countryside, often quoting from the bible and telling enchanting stories. marjorie was especially delighted. ""we were so honored to be able to go on a walk with father. he seemed so busy most of the time and we loved and respected him because of all the attention he gave us despite that. what child would feel that way about their father today?"" marjorie wondered years later.  in 1896, the newells moved to a more modern estate at 20 percy road in lexington, massachusetts. a year later, mr newell was elected chairman of the fourth national bank, now thriving in the heart of boston thanks to his oversight, wisdom and personal direction.  as the family grew, they became very close. mr newell had musical talent, and all of his daughters were taught violin by some of the best music instructors in boston. mr newell played the cello and mrs newell the piano. every sunday afternoon, the family congregated in the living room. the newell's home's choice music was a source of unfailing delight, and in history books written about lexington, the newell home was described as the site of many wonderful family musical entertainments.  as his daughters grew up, madeleine and alice went on to attend smith college in northampton, massachusetts. the elder girls were serious students while young marjorie was not. she chose to turn down the opportunity to attend smith college and freely admitted that she was not a serious student in areas that did not interest her. music and violin were her favorite recreations.  in march 1909, mr newell arranged for his family's first trip abroad to europe. none were more pleased than marjorie, who travelled with her father into boston to buy a scrapbook in which to record their journeys. the newells sailed in april aboard the white star liner romanic. they would spend more than three months visiting italy, switzerland, germany, france and england. on their return voyage home, marjorie entered the final words in her scrapbook, ""we had only our memories left of the past three months. but what were those memories - pleasant ones? yes, delightful. we have concluded that european travel is a wonderful experience and education, but like everything else in the world, everything is not perfection. but why look for unpleasantness when you leave home seeking pleasure?"" hauntingly, marjorie's next trip would end in circumstances she clearly asked herself about.  in 1912, mr newell decided to take his family overseas again. his particular area of interest was now the middle east. as a student of the bible, he very much wanted to see egypt, israel (then known as the holy land) and the surrounding areas. however, for this journey, mrs newell and daughter alice would not be joining the family. the trip to europe in 1909 had taken its toll on them. they were delicate ladies and did not feel that they had the energy or strength to make another long journey. instead, mr newell travelled with madeleine and marjorie to the lands mr newell had always wished to see.  the trio spent about three months seeing such places at cairo, bethlehem and jerusalem. marjorie remembered how impressed her father was to have seen these holy places and spoke about them constantly.  the newells left the middle east and sailed for marseilles, france in april, 1912. they eventually arrived in paris where madeleine and marjorie learned of a surprise their father had made for them. to finish such a pleasurable trip to the middle east, mr newell had made reservations for the three of them to return home to the united states aboard the maiden voyage of the rms titanic, the largest ocean liner in the world.  the newells embarked on the titanic in cherbourg, france. mr newell was assigned cabin d-48, while his daughters shared stateroom d-36. among the items they had brought with them were two violins. mr newell had reminded his girls to bring them with them so they could practice while they were touring. marjorie remembered that every evening she and her sister madeleine would play the violin in their cabins for about an hour before they went to bed.  marjorie remembered the last afternoon she would spend with her father on the titanic. she remembered sitting in deck chairs with her father and sister and talked with them about the ancient sites they had seen. she remembered looking at her father to see how pleased he was at having visited the middle east. it was as if he had finally managed to accomplish the one thing in life he had not yet done. she was very proud of him.  at dinner that last evening, marjorie remembered seeing all of the beautiful gowns being worn by the ladies as they entered the dining room for dinner. ""i had been given my first long train gown before i left home, and i took great pleasure in wearing it that night,"" marjorie said. after dinner while sitting in the titanic's reception room, mr newell pointed out mr and mrs john jacob astor to his two daughters. mr newell then turned to his daughters and asked, ""do you think you will be able to last until morning?"" he was joking with them concerning their healthy appetites. a woman who was sitting next to marjorie turned to her and said, ""don't you think the ship is going too fast? we are in the icebergs and i think we should slow down."" marjorie was unaware of the situation.  mr newell and his daughters retired at 10:30 p.m. on april 14th. about an hour and half later, marjorie remembered being awakened by the collision with the iceberg. before they could get dressed and investigate, there was a knock at their cabin door. it was mr newell. his only words were, ""get up, girls and get dressed. put on your warmest clothes and follow me.""  the sisters joined their father in the hall, and joined the other passengers heading up to the boat deck. marjorie remembered that her father was very quiet but made all possible investigations into what was going to be done. marjorie learned later that the ship had struck an iceberg and could distinctly feel the slight list the titanic was making.  when they reached the boat deck, marjorie saw one lifeboat being lowered. arthur newell turned to his daughters and told them that they would have to get into a lifeboat and row around until the damage to the titanic was repaired. he led them to lifeboat number 6 and placed them in. his last words to marjorie were, ""it does seem more dangerous for you to get into that boat than to remain here with me here but we must obey orders."" marjorie last saw her father standing back helping other women in the boat.  in her later years, marjorie thought back to that cold april night. ""i often wonder what father did after he said goodbye to us. i would like to think that he went to help other women and children. he would have never taken a place knowing there were others still aboard. i am sure he thought about my mother and sister and perhaps wished he had never taken us on this trip.""

(b. 1861)(2), charles berrian (b. 1866), marianna (b. 1869) and edwin (1873-1938).  the year prior to elizabeth's birth her family had appeared on the 1870 census as residents of an unspecified address in newburgh, new york. she first appears on the 1880 census living at west 134th street in manhattan.  still at home with her family on the 1900 census and an ongoing resident of manhattan (of an unspecified address), elizabeth was by then described as a teacher. she would lose her father on 20 july 1904 and elizabeth, her mother and sisters carrie and marianna appeared on the 1910 census still living in manhattan, now at west 120th street; elizabeth was still described as a teacher, by then in a private school.   miss shutes had been employed by president of the american can co. mr william thompson graham of greenwich, connecticut to act as a governess to his teenage daughter margaret. she had been with mrs graham and margaret in europe and were returning to the us when they boarded the titanic at southampton as first class passengers (ticket number 17582 which cost £153, 9s, 3d). whilst aboard she and margaret berthed in cabin c125 and mrs graham took c91.  at the time of the collision miss shutes and margaret were in their cabin:   ""suddenly a strange quivering ran under me, apparently the whole length of the ship. startled by the very strangeness of the shivering motion, i sprang to the floor. with too perfect a trust in that mighty vessel i again lay down. someone knocked at my door, and the voice of a friend said: ‘come quickly to my cabin; an iceberg has just passed our window; i know we have just struck one.’   the friend she was referring to was possibly mrs graham whose cabin had a porthole. as the minutes went on the mystery of what was happening began to upset young margaret who was eating a chicken sandwich; her hands were trembling to much that the sandwich began to fall apart:   no confusion, no noise of any kind, one could believe no danger imminent. our stewardess came and said she could learn nothing. looking out into the companionway i saw heads appearing asking questions from half-closed doors. all sepulchrally still, no excitement. i sat down again. my friend was by this time dressed; still her daughter and i talked on, margaret pretending to eat a sandwich. her hand shook so that the bread kept parting company from the chicken. then i saw she was frightened, and for the first time i was too, but why get dressed, as no one had given the slightest hint of any possible danger?   an officer’s cap passed the door. i asked: ‘is there an accident or danger of any kind? ‘none, so far as i know’, was his courteous answer, spoken quietly and most kindly. this same officer then entered a cabin a little distance down the companionway and, by this time distrustful of everything, i listened intently, and distinctly heard, ‘we can keep the water out for a while.’ then, and not until then, did i realize the horror of an accident at sea. now it was too late to dress; no time for a waist, but a coat and skirt were soon on; slippers were quicker than shoes; the stewardess put on our life-preservers, and we were just ready when mr. roebling came to tell us he would take us to our friend’s mother, who was waiting above …   miss shutes went on to describe the scene on the boat deck:   no laughing throng, but on either side [of the staircases] stand quietly, bravely, the stewards, all equipped with the white, ghostly life-preservers. always the thing one tries not to see even crossing on a ferry. now only pale faces, each form strapped about with those white bars. so gruesome a scene. we passed on. the awful good-byes. the quiet look of hope in the brave men’s eyes as the wives were put into the lifeboats. nothing escaped one at this fearful moment. we left from the sun deck, seventy-five feet above the water. mr case and mr, roebling, brave american men, saw us to the lifeboat, made no effort to save themselves, but stepped back on deck. later they went to an honoured grave"".  ""our lifeboat, with thirty-six in it, began lowering to the sea. this was done amid the greatest confusion. rough seamen all giving different orders. no officer aboard. as only one side of the ropes worked, the lifeboat at one time was in such a position that it seemed we must capsize in mid-air”.  “at last the ropes worked together, and we drew nearer and nearer the black, oily water. the first touch of our lifeboat on that black sea came to me as a last good-bye to life, and so we put off – a tiny boat on a great sea – rowed away from what had been a safe home for five days"".  ""the first wish on the part of all was to stay near the titanic. we all felt so much safer near the ship. surely such a vessel could not sink. i thought the danger must be exaggerated, and we could all be taken aboard again. but surely the outline of that great, good ship was growing less. the bow of the boat was getting black. light after light was disappearing, and now those rough seamen put to their oars and we were told to hunt under seats, any place, anywhere, for a lantern, a light of any kind. every place was empty. there was no water – no stimulant of any kind. not a biscuit – nothing to keep us alive had we drifted long…   rescued in lifeboat 3 with mrs graham and margaret, miss shutes sat next to mrs clara hays and her daughter mrs orian davidson.  from the boat elizabeth watched a shooting star. it reminded of the time she left japan at night. she begged two women in the boat to stop smoking but they would not.

"BADMAN, Miss Emily Louisa",18.0,Female,C3,Southampton,0.0,8.0,"        miss emily louisa badman was born in clevedon, somerset, england on 19 january 1894.   she was the daughter of solomon badman (1853-1918), a labourer, and emily cox (1861-1929), somerset natives of banwell and worle, respectively, who had married on 31 december 1878 in banwell parish church.   one of seven surviving children from a total of eleven, emily's known siblings were: mary jane (1879-1962), george (1881-1890), henry john (1883-1949), caroline1 (1886-1973), solomon charles (b. 1888), arthur (1891-1955), william james (1896-1898), ada irene2 (1899-1934) and ellen maud3 (1903-1978).  emily first appears on the 1901 census when she and her family were living at briarside, kenn, somerset. the family were listed on the 1911 census as living at 128 kenn road, clevedon but emily was absent and listed elsewhere as a domestic housemaid at holmwood, walton park, clevedon, the family home of a mr george whitfield mott-distin, a wealthy retired provision merchant, and his family.  at least two of emily's siblings had made the leap and moved to america and, hoping for a better life for herself, emily had full intentions of joining them. her sister mary jane (mrs ernest arthur) had emigrated in march 1910 along with her husband and young son cecil ernest (b. 1908), settling in skaneateles, new york and saving enough money to send emily the fare with which to join her. emily's mother was against any notion of her travelling alone across the atlantic but soon relented. it was also planned that emily was to be met in manhattan by her cousin mrs may gillis (née cox, daughter of george cox). as both cousins had never met, they had arranged to wear a bow of orange (or yellow, depending on the article) ribbon tied to each of their left wrists in order to ease identification.  after being accompanied to the white star line terminal by a brother, miss badman boarded the titanic at southampton as a third-class passenger (ticket number a/4 31416 which cost  £8 1s) and she and three other women shared a cabin located somewhere in the bow.  whilst aboard she made the acquaintance of several other english passengers, including sarah roth, and the goldsmith family, and possibly also gained an admirer, edward lockyer. in interviews many years later emily recalled some particulars about him, including the fact that he was from sandhurst, a minute detail possibly indicating that the pair got to know each other quite well aboard the ship.   sometime around the evening of 14 april 1912 emily and edward lockyer had enjoyed a stroll together on the open deck; fearing the breeze would pull her spectacles off of her face, emily removed them and gave them to lockyer for safekeeping, along with a small mesh purse containing some coins. he placed the items in his pocket and the pair went on with their stroll. later over dinner, she told her companion that she would love the opportunity to see such a grand ship such as titanic from a smaller boat. that evening she went to bed at around 10.30 pm.   in an interview printed in the auburn citizen (24 april 1912), emily recalled being awoken by a sound ""as if the boat were scraping land""; she dressed and left her cabin to investigate and found the passageways ""filled with foreigners going up on deck loaded with luggage,"" many wearing cumbersome lifebelts. in another interview with the skaneateles free press (23 april 1912), miss badman recalled hearing stewards imploring some other women passengers to get dressed and head up top but that they were unmoved and scoffed at such suggestions.   emily badman the democrat, 25 april 1912  miss badman went to one of the upper decks where she encountered edward lockyer who told her to go back to her cabin for heavier clothing. she did not want to do so and instead, he helped her into a lifebelt. she found this piece of lifesaving apparatus so mortifying that she put her coat on over the top of it so that others could not see her wearing it.    the same interview, perhaps embellished either by herself or the reporter, stated that miss badman and lockyer waited on deck (perhaps the aft well-deck) for some time before a call for ""... all women and children this way"" came. again she was reluctant to go but lockyer took her and guided her up to the lifeboats. on deck, she described seeing two men shot, one a steward who refused to cooperate with an officer, and the other an italian who had jumped into a lowering lifeboat. she described being one of the last-placed in her lifeboat before it was lowered and later recalled catching a final glance at the young man who had been so considerate of her safety, edward lockyer.  it was only after the lifeboat was launched that emily realised how deep titanic had sunk. she then recalled the conversation she had had with lockyer earlier about how she wanted to see titanic from a smaller boat; she did not realise that wish would come true, nor in such circumstances.   after her lifeboat rowed out about a mile miss badman recalled hearing two explosions coming from the ship which then broke in two:  ""... the front end went down at once and the back stood up so that it was almost straight and then went out of sight."" - the auburn citizen, 24 april 1912  with the ship foundered emily recalled the screams of those left behind; naively she thought that, with most wearing life preservers, they would later be picked up safely. she herself suffered from exposure and found the conditions in the lifeboat to be cramped.  in which lifeboat miss badman escaped is unclear; in a 1912 interview (skaneateles free press, 23 april 1912) she stated she escaped in the last lifeboat but one and as such several historians place her in collapsible c. however, in a 1932 interview with the record it was stated that she was in lifeboat 13, she described the skipper of the boat, a stoker, telling the occupants of the boat to sing to drown out the cries of those struggling in the water. lifeboat 13 was the second to last lifeboat in its section of the boat deck to leave so she may well have been in this boat.  miss badman recalled that she tried to help reassure some women who had parted from their husbands that they might end up in new york before them. as her lifeboat approached at around 7.00 am emily, still trying to buoy the hopes of the other survivors, joked that their lifeboat was oxford and that another nearby was cambridge and it became a competition to see who would win the race to the rescue ship.  the enormity of the tragedy only dawned on emily when she was aboard carpathia; it was there she noticed how few men had survived and also realised that she was the only one from a total of twenty people from her dining table aboard titanic. she also noted how many other women whose faces she had become familiar with over the journey were nowhere to be seen. in a 1938 interview, emily recalled sharing a compartment aboard carpathia with another woman whose hair turned white overnight.    arriving in new york emily was described as an unmarried domestic aged 18 and gave her destination as to the home of her sister, mrs ernest arthur, in skaneateles. before going there she spent time recuperating in st vincent's hospital due to the effects of shock and exposure. despite all the hardships she had endured she never allowed her bow of orange ribbon to be taken from her and when her cousin mrs gillis arrived in manhattan to search for her, scouring hospitals for survivors, she was also wearing her own ribbon as planned. the recognition between the two women was instantaneous. before leaving manhattan emily acted as bridesmaid to fellow survivor sarah roth who married daniel iles in st vincent's hospital on 23 april.  ",Servant,3rd Class Passenger,,C,English,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/emily-badman.html

"ALLEN, Miss Elisabeth Walton",29.0,Female,C1,Southampton,0.0,211.0,"        elisabeth walton allen was born in st louis, missouri on 1 october 1882.  she was the daughter of george washington allen (b. 31 march 1852), a lawyer and railroad capitalist from st louis, and lydia jeanette mcmillan (b. 8 october 1853) who was born in la porte, indiana. the couple were married on 21 june 1876 in mount pleasant, pennsylvania. her father, who came from a wealthy family and who was active in local politics, was a member of the city council and one-time mayor of st louis whilst his father thomas was a builder of the iron mountain railroad and the southern hotel in st louis.  one of five children, elisabeth’s four siblings were: thomas iii (b. 8 september 1877; d. 1947), clare (b. 6 march 1881; d. 1970), george walton hocker (b. 19 november 1889; d. 1973) and whitelaw reid (b. 26 february 1891; d. 1972).  in the late 1890s the family moved from st louis to princeton, new jersey and appear on the 1900 census living at 83 mercer street, princeton; her father had no stated profession at the time. elisabeth and her sister clare were students at vassar college in poughkeepsie, new york during this timeframe (she was still listed as a student as late as 1904). it was also around this time that the family began to fall apart, her father soon beginning to live in hotels, including the southern hotel in st louis which his family had founded.   	 		 			 			 			 		 		 			george w. allen, elisabeth’s father (1892), her mother lydia (1916) and brother thomas (1920) 		 	   elisabeth’s mother was, by reports, burdened with alcoholism and in an attempt to cure her her husband had sent her, by her own request, to paris in the hope that the change of surroundings might help her to “overcome her weakness.” with that trip not having the desired effect, she was dispatched to canada for the same purpose but again to no avail. his eleventh-hour attempt was to send her to an institute in boston in early january 1901, again without the desired result. before leaving for st louis on business he instructed his son thomas, a new york-based lawyer, to remove his younger brothers from the family home.    elisabeth’s younger brothers george (1920) and whitelaw (1918)  mrs allen, who later stated that she was in boston on “a matter of business” but falling ill and bedridden for a stretch, wrote and telegraphed her home asking for her two youngest sons to be brought to her. these requests went unanswered and when mrs allen was sufficiently well to travel she returned to princeton to find that both her youngest sons were nowhere to be found and could not determine their whereabouts for several days. they had been taken by their elder brother thomas to new york where they stayed at a boarding house at 46 east 21st street. on learning of their location mrs allen immediately hastened to fetch them but thomas allen refused to surrender the two boys. she immediately launched legal proceedings, alleging her sons had been kidnapped and “restrained of their liberty” by their elder brother.  it soon emerged that lydia’s husband george washington allen, who was still in st louis on business, had declared that he had ordered his son thomas to remove the two boys from the family home because his wife lydia, whom he accused of habitual drunkenness, “was not the proper person to have charge of them” and threatened to fight the proceedings in the courts. mr allen went on to say:   “they were not abducted. i told my elder son to secure possession of the children and to keep them away from their mother. he did so. i don’t know where he took them. i expect to do all i can to prevent their mother from securing them again, as she is not the proper kind of a person to have charge of them.” - the st louis republic, 21 january 1901   at the ensuing trial, the two young boys who had been separated from their mother ran to her and they caressed in an emotional scene. both boys were soon reigned into their brother’s control in the courtroom.  the outcome of the legal process was not favourable for mrs allen, who attempted to defend her alcoholism on the grounds of medical requirements. further to this, george washington allen filed for divorce on 1 january 1902, citing his wife’s 15-year-long drinking habit and the “intolerable humiliation and indignities” he suffered as a result. the hearing was brief and the st louis republic reported on 16 january 1902 that mr allen was granted a divorce and awarded the custody of his two minor sons.  with a divorce finalised george washington allen promptly remarried in march 1903 to a miss eliza doherty of atlanta.  elisabeth’s mother never remarried and divided her time between st louis and cazenovia, new york. the 1910 census shows mrs allen with her sons george and whitelaw as residents of the green in cazenovia but elisabeth was not listed at the address. instead, for the previous few years she had been spending considerable portions of her time in europe, particularly britain, and in january 1911 travelled with her maternal aunt mrs elisabeth mcmillan robert and her daughter, miss allen’s cousin georgette madill, the heiress of a large fortune. during this time she became engaged to physician james beaver mennell. her sister clare was engaged around the same time to harvard history professor charles homer haskins.  james beaver mennell was born in shepherds bush, london, england on 31 january 1880 to surgeon zebulon mennell and the former jane lilias hudson gillies. by 1911 he was a boarder at 107 palace road in lambeth, london and was described as the resident medical officer of st thomas’ house.  elisabeth was set to return to her home in st. louis with her aunt and miss madill. intending to gather her belongings and settle her affairs in the us for preparation for her imminent marriage, miss allen, her aunt, cousin and her aunt’s maid emilie kreuchen all boarded the titanic in southampton as first-class passengers. for the voyage, miss allen shared cabin b-5 with cousin georgette, whilst mrs robert was across the hall in cabin b3 . the entire party travelled under ticket number 24160 (which cost £221, 16s, 9d).   elisabeth allen  (the paterson press, 20 april 1912)  miss allen escaped the sinking with her relatives in lifeboat 2, one of the last boats to leave the titanic, under the command of fourth officer joseph boxhall.   regarding the disaster, miss allen wrote:   mrs. j. b. mennell (née allen):  my aunt, mrs. roberts' maid, came to the door and asked if she could speak to me. i went into the corridor and she said: "" miss allen, the baggage room is full of water."" i replied she needn't worry, that the water-tight compartments would be shut and it would be all right for her to go back to her cabin. she went back and returned to us immediately to say her cabin, which was forward on deck e, was flooded.  we were on the boat deck some minutes before being ordered into the lifeboat. neither my aunt, mrs. roberts, my cousin, miss madill, nor myself ever saw or heard the band. as we stood there we saw a line of men file by and get into the boat-some sixteen or eighteen stokers. an officer i came along and shouted to them: ""get out, you damned cowards; i'd like to see everyone of you overboard."" they all got out and the officer said: ""women and children into this boat,"" and we got in and were lowered.  with the exception of two very harrowing leave-takings, we saw nothing but perfect order and quiet on board the titanic. we were rowed round the stern to the starboard side and away from the ship, as our boat was a small one and boxhall feared the suction. mrs. cornell helped to row all the time.

""when i saw that he was not coming,"" said mrs. goldenberg, ""i called, 'for god's sake say goodby to me then,' and suddenly mr. ismay and one of the crew seized mr. goldenberg and threw him over the side. he managed to catch the boat ropes and i and others pulled him in...""  once aboard carpathia mr goldenberg sought out the ship's barber to purchase toiletries.  met by friends and colleagues at the new york pier following their arrival aboard carpathia, the goldenbergs refused to discuss their ordeal with newspaper reporters. they went on to take part in the french bull dog show.  following the disaster the couple shortly returned to france and also spent time in switzerland for recuperation. as per his 1916 passport samuel stood at 5' 6½"", had an oval face with a small mouth and chin and was of fair complexion with blue/grey eyes and chestnut hair.  by 1917 he and nella were still living in villefranche-sur-mer and spent time residing in monaco. an affidavit in his 1920 passport states that, whilst a resident of villefranche-sur-mer, he had previously lived at 5 rue chalfrin (avenue du bois-de-bolougne). by 1921 samuel had apparently resettled permanently in the usa, living at 109 fifth avenue, manhattan, but continued to travel despite ill health in later years.  samuel and nella were later divorced and he was remarried to a lady of polish nobility, edwiga grabówska and resettled in nice where he had a villa. known as a charitable man, and continuing his love of dogs, goldenberg was later president of the canine d'savoie and also founded a charity for those afflicted with blindness.

"BURKE, Mr William",39.0,Male,Crew,Belfast,0.0,0.0,"        mr william burke was born at clifton terrace in glenbrook near queenstown (modern-day cobh) in co cork, ireland on 5 november 1872.1 he was baptised on 14 november the same year.     william’s birth registration  he was the son of james burke (b. circa 1837), a shipwright, and catherine calway (b. circa 1843) who had married in 1866.   he had eight known siblings, including two sets of twins: catherine (b. 27 june 1867), ellen (b. circa 1868), catherine mary (b. 4 april 1875), twins hanna and lizzie (b. 29 september 1877), twins rebecca and james (b. 8 october 1880) and agnes (b. 6 january 1884).   the family apparently moved to britain sometime after 1884 and they appear on the 1891 census living at 216 arlington street, kirkdale, lancashire, with a young william being described as a grocer's assistant.   the family later appear on the 1901 census as residents of virginia street, bootle, the home address of his sister mrs edward (ellen) campbell and her family; william, then aged 28, was still a grocer's assistant.   by 1902 william burke had already begun service at sea and was shown serving as a steward aboard the haverford of the american line before making several trips aboard cymric of the white star line; at that stage, his liverpool address was 8 grove street. during 1903 he was living at 23 belmont drive and was serving aboard suevic before joining the majestic on which he would serve for several years. by 1907 he was a resident of 7 aubrey street, liverpool.  when burke signed-on to the titanic on 4 april 1912 he gave his address as 57 bridge road, southampton2.  his previous ship had been the olympic and as a first-class dining room steward he received monthly wages of £3, 15s.  during the voyage burkes assigned passengers were isidor and ida straus; he recalled that they came to dine at 7.15 pm on sunday 14 april but never saw them after that.  at the time of the collision, burke was in his quarters in his bunk but not asleep. the sensation of the impact brought him to the conclusion that the ship had dropped as propeller blade and he remained unstirred from his bunk for around 15 minutes before getting up. another 15 minutes or so passed before an order filtered down to get dressed and to bring overcoats and lifebelts and head up top. burke did as commanded but nearly left without a lifebelt, a colleague reminding him to fetch one. burke made his way topside and positioned himself at the starboard boat deck and went o his assigned boat, boat 1, but found that it had already left.  burke busied himself assisting in the loading of other lifeboats on the starboard side before crossing to the port side and assisting in loading and lowering boat 8 before heading aft to boat 10. chief officer wilde was conducting matters around boat 10 and his query as to how many seamen were in the boat was answered by ""two, sir."" wilde called out if there were any men who could handle an oar and a man, who burke took to be a foreigner, approached the chief; he could not hear their conversation but wilde brushed the man aside, saying ""you are of no use to me."" burke approached the officer and told him that he could handle an oar and he was immediately told to board the lifeboat. another unidentified officer arrived on the scene at this time.  burke assisted women and children into the boat; one of the last to attempt to board fell between the side of the lifeboat and the deck; burke miraculously caught her ankle and attempted to haul her into the boat but a man on a-deck had other ideas and attempted to pull her onto the deck--burke eventually relinquished the woman to the other man.  after the boat was lowered burke took an oar with a seaman and fireman charles rice and he helped row the boat about a quarter of a mile out from the ship. during the night boat 10 was tied to other boats to form a flotilla and received more passengers from other boats.   during the night some women drew his attention to the fact that there were two men hiding in the bottom of the boat; he approached and extricated both men from their hiding places; one was japanese (masabumi hosono) and the other, a large man, burke identified as italian but all the man could say was ""armenian."" he put the two men to the oars.   upon arrival in new york burke was called as a witness to the us inquiry, giving evidence on day 9 (27 april 1912).   william burke (centre) with fellow surviving stewards f. dent ray (left) and andrew cunningham (right) (library of congress)  burke resumed his career at sea; by 1930, at age 57, he was a steward aboard the ss leviathan and, for reasons unknown, held us seaman papers. he was described as standing at 5’ 10” and had black hair, brown eyes and a fair complexion.     william burke in 1930, alongside his left thumbprint   william’s signature in 1930   william had married in liverpool on 23 june 1917 to mary elizabeth osborne (b. 1894) and they had three children: william francis (1918-1918), lilian winifred (b. 1921, later mrs ronald jones) and harold edmund (b. 1922). their firstborn, william, lived just five days and was later buried in ford cemetery, liverpool.  during the 1950s william spoke of his experiences whilst titanic-mania was at its height following the publication of a night to remember and the following book-turned-movie.

according to him ismay was in the lifeboat for some time, helping others cross into the boat and did not, as many outlets would otherwise state, step into the boat as it was lowered.  after boat c was lowered brown stated that he and others turned their attention to working on collapsible a which was housed atop the officer's quarters, the men using two planks they'd procured from somewhere near the bow and sliding the boat down to the boat deck. their attempts to hook that boat up to the davits proved more troublesome, however, as a growing list to starboard prevented them from being able to get it to the davits. only with the falls slackened off did they manage to get the boat secured but the growing list made sure that the men working there were unable to sling the boat outboard as would be normal.   brown reported that the captain passed by around this time, megaphone in hand, saying to them ""well, boys, do your best for the women and children, and look out for yourselves."" before walking towards the bridge. he also observed a group of four or five women stood nearby waiting to board the collapsible but during the struggle to get the boat ready to launch the ship plunged and the bridge and forward boat deck was inundated.   brown, presumably situated at the after fall, found himself knee-deep in seawater and managed to pull himself into the collapsible boat where he then cut through the aft-fall before calling out to someone situated forward to do the same but he could not say if anyone complied as he was washed out of the boat at that point and he saw the handful of women who had been waiting nearby struggling in the water nearby himself.  whilst in the water brown reported being caught in a whirlpool of water due to the suction and was dragged down a bit before coming up again. he heard a large rumbling or explosion after resurfacing and saw a lot of people in the water nearby, the lights of the ship still burning, and related that he believed the bow separated from stern at this point.  situated near the forward funnel of the ship brown saw a black object ahead of him and did his best to make towards it. brown, who was unable to swim, later credited his lifebelt for his salvation and he was able to pull himself toward collapsible a which was half-submerged and which he estimated had 16 or 17 persons aboard it. during the night they pulled a woman (rhoda abbott) and ""a very big gentleman"" from the ocean. he recalled three stewards and one fireman aboard, the rest being passengers and he recalled barber august weikman and steward william watson lucas being among the crowd. the occupants were later rescued by boat 14 sometime after daylight.   safely in boat 14 brown found his hands and feet had swollen, the latter bloated enough to have burst his boots. despite that he volunteered to take an oar and situated himself on the portside.   although not required to give evidence at the american inquiry, upon return to britain edward was called to give evidence to the british inquiry on day 9. edward continued to work at sea; by 1920 he was a saloon steward aboard cretic and immigration records at the time describe him as standing at 5' 8½"" and weighing 140 lbs. in 1924 he was working as a bedroom steward aboard laconia.  he was married in 1919 to bertha holden (b. 10 may 1890 in liverpool) and the couple had a daughter the following year, elizabeth margaret (b. 26 january 1920).     edward brown c.1920  his family believe that the titanic disaster had an adverse effect on edward's health and this contributed to his early death in liverpool on 3 june 1926.  he is buried in kirkdale cemetery, liverpool, england (section c/e 17, plot 3293 in an unmarked public grave.

"CARTER, Mrs Lucile",36.0,Female,C1,Southampton,1.0,120.0,"        mrs lucile carter, née polk, was born in baltimore, maryland on 8 october 1875.1  she was the daughter of william stewart polk (1827-1917), and louisa ellen anderson (1844-1933) who were married in montgomery, tennessee on 22 june 1869. one of her paternal ancestors was the eleventh us president, james knox polk (1795-1849).  lucile had two brothers, anderson (b. 17 march 1870; d. 1949) and david peale (b. 9 may 1880; d. 1959).  her washington, dc-born father had come to baltimore with his family as an adolescent and began his career as a clerk with a shipping company until entering naval service in 1853 as a paymaster before receiving an appointment to the virginia military institute. with the outbreak of the civil war he was commissioned a captain of engineers for the confederate army and served in that capacity for the duration, later returning to baltimore where he became involved in the insurance business, entering the underwriting field in 1866 as a member of the firm of john s. selby & co., later becoming sole partner of the agency. he later married lou ellen anderson, a native of kentucky2, in 1869.  coming from wealth and pedigree, lucile was universally described as one of the most beautiful young women in baltimore social circles; her engagement to philadelphia-born mining heir william ernest carter was announced in october 1895:  the engagement of miss lucile polk, of baltimore, to mr. william e. carter, of philadelphia, has just been announced. miss polk is the only daughter of mr and mrs william stewart polk, and for two seasons in baltimore and at narragansett has been a great belle and noted beauty. she is a first cousin of the beautiful mrs. stilson hutchins of washington, who chaperoned her at narragansett this summer. mr carter is a son of the late william t. carter, of philadelphia, and met miss polk at narragansett, where his coach and four were daily at her disposal. the wedding will take place in january, and will be an event of much fashionable importance in baltimore.  - new york herald, 25 october 1895  both were married at franklin street presbyterian church in baltimore on 29 january 1896:  ... the bride wore a handsome princess gown of heavy white satin with train, a marie antoinette point lace collar and tulle veil, and carried a bouquet of white orchids. there were no bridesmaids, and miss alice carter, sister of the groom, was the maid of honor. edgar trotter price, of philadelphia, acted as best man... a wedding breakfast followed at the mount vernon hotel, after which mr and mrs carter started for florida for a short trip, when they will return to philadelphia. in the spring they will sail for europe.  - philadelphia times, 30 january 1896  the couple had two children: lucile polk (1898-1962) and william thornton (1900-1985).  at the beginning of their marriage the young couple settled at 1910 rittenhouse square, philadelphia, but later their country residence, “gwedna"" in bryn mawr became their main home and the location of numerous magnificent receptions and dinners. quickly william and lucile carter became part of the fashionable and cosmopolitan circles in newport, baltimore, new york, washington and philadelphia, which included the astors, vanderbilts, wideners, goelets and drexels. the carters usually spent the summer in newport, rhode island, where in 1901 they purchased their cottage “quatrefoil” in narragansett avenue.  the family travelled extensively in europe, especially in england where they remained for protracted periods. passenger lists furnish proof of their voyages in 1902, 1904-1906, 1907, 1908-1910. on 20 february 1906, at the first royal levee of the season, whitelaw reid, united states ambassador to the united kingdom, presented william ernest carter to king edward vii.  mrs carter often appeared in gossip pages, noted her athletic prowess (she was reportedly the first woman to play polo riding astride) and her beauty:  in newport mrs carter was declared to be the most perfect type of blonde in american society. withal, she was as vivacious as the most sparkling-eyed brunette. she was rival of her husband in the matter of smartly driving a four-in-hand. - times dispatch on 16 may 1911  her glamorous and often audacious fashions were also frequently noted, one example coming from the times dispatch on 16 may 1911:  society woman in green tights  mrs “willie” carter startles fashionable hotel crowds by daring costume  philadelphia, may 15—the harem is a shrinking violet of a costume compared to that worn by mrs willie carter, the famous golden-haired philadelphia beauty, on an evening recently in the corridors of the bellevue-stratford hotel in this city. the wealthy young matron, who is well-known in new york, newport and london society, herself appeared nonchalant and unconscious of the surprise, sensation, to say nothing of consternation, that she was causing in her stroll around the thickly carpeted lane of the hotel, and she seemed equally unaware that word had passed outside, so that men and youths pressed in from the street to have a look for themselves at the “lady wearing tights.”  tights, obviously, mrs carter was wearing. they were of glossy silk, and they were green—a vivid if tempered green. she was accompanied by a woman friend during her rambles in the hotel corridors. when she alighted from her motor car and entered the big, brilliantly lighted lobby nothing unusual was noticed regarding her costume.  her cloak flung back  she wore a chic parisian hat and a long opera coat, but as she strolled about the cloak became a trifle oppressive and she flung it open and back upon her shoulders and continued strolling. her sang-froid was decidedly piquant, considering that in throwing open her opera coat the full length of the green silk tights was displayed…  in may 1911 the carter family sailed aboard the lusitania for england once again. they participated in the coronation celebration of their majesties king george v and queen mary and the london season. in winter william carter rented rotherby manor in melton-mowbray district, leicestershire to attend the hunting season.  in march 1912 the family decided to return to america and made reservations on the olympic, departing from southampton on 3 april. at the last minute, they changed their plans and booked cabins on titanic.  mrs carter boarded the titanic at southampton as a first-class passenger together with her husband and their children lucile and william. they held ticket number 113760 (which cost £120) and occupied cabins b-96 and 98. also travelling were mrs carter's maid augusta serreplaà, mr carter's manservant alexander cairns and, travelling in second class, carter's chauffeur augustus aldworth. two family pets were also making the crossing, an airedale terrier and mrs carter's pekinese spaniel,

first married, at age 18, to james stuart wallace by whom she had a child. 3 they were divorced in 1888 4 and she was left virtually penniless. 5 in order to make some money to support herself and her child she set up a dressmaking business. in 1894 she rented a shop and workspace at 24 old burlington street, london, between bond street and regent street. 6 'maison lucile' was a success and the 'personality' dresses of 'lucile' were immediately popular. each design was unique which enhanced their appeal. in 1897 new, larger premises were purchased at 17 hanover square. 7 by 1900 the firm had become one of the great couture houses of london under the name 'the maison lucile.' her clientele included margot asquith and the duchess of york (later queen mary). 8 in 1910 she opened a branch of lucile ltd. in new york. a further salon was established in paris in 1912 9, and in 1915 a branch in chicago expanded the empire. 10

because 'lucile' travelled so much, they rarely lived together. between 1906 and 1914 they had a home at 22 lennox gardens, knightsbridge. 12 lucile's paris address was 14 avenue du bois de boulogne while she also had a summer villa, 'pavillon mars' at 4 rue d'angivillers, versailles, only about half a mile from the palace. 13 she had no residence in the united sates and usually stayed at the waldorf-astoria, the ritz-carlton or the plaza. 14 aside from the financial security her husband gave her, lady duff-gordon would later explain how her aristocratic connections would prove more acceptable at court (i.e. before the queen) than before when she was merely a dressmaker, although she was never really accepted at court because of her divorce. 15

uneventful. like everyone else i was entranced by the beauty of the liner. i had never dreamed of sailing in such luxury ... my pretty little cabin, with its electric heater and pink curtains, delighted me, so that it was a pleasure to go to bed. everything about this lovely ship reassured me.  i remember that last meal on titanic very well. we had a big vase of beautiful daffodils on the table, which were as fresh as if they had just been picked. everyone was very gay, and at a neighbouring table people were making bets on the probable time of this record breaking run. various opinions were put forward, but none dreamed that titanic would make her harbour that night ...  i had been in bed for about an hour and the lights were all out, when i was awakened by a funny,
